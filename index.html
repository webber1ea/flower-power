    <p>Flowers often pick up religious and spiritual meanings because they rise from dirt and only show their beauty for a brief amount of time each year. The Lotus Flower is no different from the rest of the blooms used for decorating and religious ceremonies. Few flowers are as important to Eastern cultures as the Lotus, and each culture ascribes a slightly different meaning to the flower. Dive into the depths of the Lotus blossom meaning by looking at every aspect of this fascinating plant.</p>

      <p>The Lotus is a delicate flower with many layered petals arrayed around a central core. A few different plants from separate families all make up this category, but they all have similar meanings when it comes to symbolism. The plants also look alike and share other characteristics like medicinal and edible value. In general, all the Lotus flowers exude beauty and grace. Most varieties grow in the water of ponds and creeks, lending them an otherworldly quality that makes them mystical enough for religious ceremonies. In the Victorian flower language, the Lotus represented eloquence.</p>

      <p>The Egyptian lotus flower: With the scientific name of Nymphaea caerula, the Egyptian blue lotus is actually more accurately described as a water lily. These blooms sport light blue or purple petals and played an important role in spiritual events. The Japanese lotus flower: Also known as the sacred Lotus in China, Bali, and other tropical countries in Asia, this plant’s scientific name is Nelumbo nucifera. It is the flower you see being used as the seat of Buddha and many Hindu deities too. The American lotus flower: A bright yellow Lotus, the Nelumbo lutea, is native to North America and was used as a food crop by many Native American tribes. It is not as well known symbolically as the other varieties, but it is still a beautiful addition to a water feature. Other Lotuses: Most white and red Lotus flower varieties also fall into the Nymphaea water lily family. This means they held the most power in Egyptian and other ancient Asian cultures.

      <p>The color of the Lotus certainly affects its general meaning as well. The white lotus flower and pink lotus flower from the Nelumbo family are seen as meaning purity and devotion. More passionately colored red, purple, and blue Lotus flower blooms can take on a spiritual meaning of ascension, enlightenment, or rebirth. A green Lotus flower is a beautiful gift for anyone trying to improve their life and start good habits

    <p>Aside from the Victorian and contemporary meanings for the Lotus, there is a wealth of symbolism tying these flowers to Hinduism, Buddhism, and the ancient Egyptian’s religious practices. The ancient Egyptians used the plant extensively as a symbol in the paintings and carvings left on the walls of temples and tombs. Scholars believe the Egyptians viewed the Lotus as a symbol of rebirth because it appeared to sink at night and rise again in the morning. It is now known the plant simply loses old blooms and adds new ones on a daily cycle, but it is still a potent reminder of reincarnation and the mysteries of the afterlife. The priests and other religious leaders also brewed the flowers to make a tea with sedative and mild psychotropic effects, which heightened their sense for ritual work. The Lotus meaning in Hinduism is a little different. As ideas were exchanged with Buddhists for thousands of years, Hindu religious leaders began to use the flower as a symbol of peace and eternity. White lotus flowers are usually seen under the feet of deities like Lakshmi, Ganesha, and Saraswati. Brahma, the ultimate creator, emerges from a Lotus as well. This sense of purity arises from the flower’s growing habit of rooting in mud and pushing up through the water to bloom.

    <p>Buddhist studies use the lotus flower in guided meditations. The meditation instructs practitioners to imagine themselves as a tiny lotus seed that is deeply buried in the mud. While the mud is dirty and uncomfortable, the seed's journey is to move calmly through the darkness and into the light. Once the seed completes the journey, it blossoms into the next stage of life. The lotus symbolizes growth and determination.
    The lotus flower is a popular design for tattoos and art, as it is a daily reminder that perseverance and inner strength results in light and beauty. The lotus position is a common yoga pose in which the student sits in a cross legged position, relaxed and still. Lotus flowers are white to pink in color, and they give off a pleasant fragrance. The lotus is also a prominent symbol in Hindu mythology, and it is also known as the white water lily.

      <p>The white lotus flower symbolizes a pure mind and spirit, while the red lotus flower symbolizes passion. Blue lotus flowers represent common sense. The pink lotus flower represents the history of Buddhism and its teachings. The gold lotus flower signifies the highest levels of enlightenment and achievement.
        The mud in which the lotus flower blooms represents human suffering. The Buddhists believe suffering is part of a grand design to make human beings stronger. As the lotus flower grows through the mud and the murk, this represents humans rising above their earthly woes in order to enter a state of enlightenment.

<h1>The Daisy Flower</h1>

  <div class="info">
    <p>When botanists refer to daisies, they mean an entire group of plant species in the plant family called Asteraceae, which also includes aster flowers, ragweed and sunflowers. Daisies can be found in many parts of the world, including North America, Europe and Africa.The modern English word daisy comes from an Old English word that’s impossible to spell and next to impossible to pronounce. The important thing is that the Old English word meant “day’s eye” because daisy flowers only opened during the daytime. “Daisy” also became a slang word for something of excellent quality, as shown in books printed in the early 1800s. Over the generations, “that’s a daisy” became changed to “that’s a doozy.”

    <p>A single daisy flower is actually made up of two separate flowers. The center petals are one flower surrounded by the “rays” of another flower. Daisies grow all year round. Daisies are naturally resistant to many plant diseases and pests, which makes them perfect flowers for new gardeners. Unfortunately, the English daisy (Bellis perennis) is considered a stubborn weed in North American lawns. For centuries, children and really bored child minders have used daisies in order  to make daisy chains. Daisy leaves are edible. Some people add them to their salads. Wild daisy tea is said to be good for ailments of the throat, for putting on open wounds and as a “blood purifier” (whatever that means) but there aren’t any clinical studies to back up these traditional claims. People who are allergic to ragweed are very likely to also be allergic to daisies or any products made from daisies.
